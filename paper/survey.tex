\subsection{Survey design}
\label{sec:survey-design}

We investigate how Tor users interact with onion services by designing and
administering a survey.

\subsubsection{Research question}
We designed the survey to answer the following research questions: \emph{How do
Tor users interact with onion services?}  An answer to this research question
allows us to both create more usable anonymity systems and build these systems
in a way that human-centered attacks such as phishing are exacerbated.  In
particular, we seek to answer the following three aspects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the expectation of privacy when people use Tor Browser in
        general and onion sites in particular?
    \item What is the security/usability trade-off of vanity onion domains?
    \item Do people handle onion domains differently than normal domains?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our survey consists of six blocks:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Consent and demographics
            \item Tor usage
            \item Onion site usage
            \item Onion site operation
            \item Onion site phishing and impersonation
            \item Expectations of privacy
        \end{enumerate}
    \item We implemented our survey in Qualtrics and made sure that it can be
        answered correctly over Tor Browser---it needed JavaScript, though.
        Used a Qualtrics feature so that participants can answer the survey only
        once.
    \item We used four screener questions distributed over four distinct
        blocks, \ie, questions whose sole purpose is to check whether the
        respondent is paying attention.~\cite{Berinsky2014a}.
    \item Having followed mailing lists \etc for many years, we did not feel the
        need for focus groups to explore what topics are worth inquiring.
    \item Used cognitive pretesting (sometimes also called cognitive
        interviewing)~\cite{Collins2003a}.  Pretesting can show us that
        respondents \first understand questions, \second understand questions
        consistently, and \third understand questions the way that we intended.
        Two main strategies are \emph{think-aloud interviewing} and
        \emph{probing}.  In addition, we can ask respondends about the
        confidence they have in their responses.  However, not all cognitive
        processes can be verbalized and cognitive pretesting may change the way
        respondents answer questions.  We had $N$ respondents (talk about
        demographics) based on whose input we iteratively improved our survey.
        $M$ respondents were fluent, but non-native English speakers.
    \item We tried hard to have neutral, non-leading questions.
    \item Basic statistics.  The survey consists of X questions and takes
        approximately Y minutes to complete.  We used our university's
        Qualtrics membership to create the survey.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Participant recruiting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tor's population is unknown.  We barely know its size.  Besides, there
        is no way to recruit all Tor users with equal probability.  Therefore,
        we will have inevitable sampling bias in our results.  We work around
        that by using diverse recruitment media and making our sample size as
        large as possible.
    \item Post on Tor's blog\\\url{https://blog.torproject.org/blog/take-part-study-help-improve-onion-services}.
    \item Tor tweeted it\\\url{https://twitter.com/torproject}
    \item Post on social media such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \url{https://reddit.com/r/tor/}
            \item \url{https://reddit.com/r/onions/}
            \item \url{https://reddit.com/r/samplesize/}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Started survey on 2017-08-16 and ended survey on 2017-XX-XX.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are our results generalizable to self-authenticating names?
    \item Use aided recall for behavioral questions.
    \item Questions should be non-threatening (is there a ``right'' or ``wrong''
        answer?).  If respondents think they would
        look bad, they may answer not truthfully.
    \item Avoid jargon and unusual vocabulary (to non-native English speakers)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Incentives for participation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Difficult to do in anonymous fashion so we decided to not have
        incentives for survey.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data analysis}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Representative sample?
\end{itemize}
