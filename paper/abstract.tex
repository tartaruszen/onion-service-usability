\subsection*{Abstract}
% Problem statement.
Onion services are anonymous TCP services that are only accessible over the Tor
network.  As of November 2017 more than 50,000 onion services provide anonymous
web sites, chat protocols, and file sharing services.  This surge in popularity
brought with it a Wild West of phishing attacks and scams, countered by ad-hoc
countermeasures and usability improvements.  These countermeasures have in
common that they have not been formally studied.
% What we are doing.
In this work we fill this gap by studying how people perceive, understand, and
use onion services.  To that end we employ a mixed-methods approach consisting
of semi-structured interviews to explore the problem space, and an online
survey to solicit answers to concrete questions.  We find that users place great
trust in The Tor Project but distrust content that is hosted on onion services.
Users have devised a diverset set of methods to work around the non-memorable
domain format.
% Why our work matters.
Our work enables privacy engineers---in particular Tor developers---to improve
their technology.
