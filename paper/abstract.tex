\subsection*{Abstract}
% Problem statement.
Onion services are anonymous TCP services that are exposed over the Tor network.
Compared to conventional Internet services, onion services are barely indexed by
search engines; private by default; and employ long, self-authenticating domain
names.  Our understanding of how users handle these idiosyncrasies is anecdotal.
% What we are doing.
In this work we fill this gap by studying how people perceive, understand, and
use onion services.  To that end we explored the problem space by conducting
seventeen semi-structured interviews.  Having gained preliminary insight, we
then solicited answers to concrete questions by administering an online survey
that attracted 828 responses.  Our findings show that \first~onion service
discovery is met with dissatisfaction, but could be greatly improved with an
opt-in publishing mechanism; \second~users handle the non-memorable domain
format by employing diverse makeshift solutions, some of which Tor Browser could
provide; and \third~some users misunderstand the technology behind onion
services which may facilitate phishing attacks.
% Why our work matters.
Our work allows The Tor Project to focus its efforts on the most pressing
usability issues and to address common misconceptions by improving its
documentation, improving both security and usability in the process.
