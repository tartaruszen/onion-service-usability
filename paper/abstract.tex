% Problem statement.
We lack a sound understanding of how users interact with onion services.
% What we are doing.
In this work we fill this gap by conducting a series of semi-structured
interviews and an online survey to understand the expectations, assumptions,
habits, and issues that onion service users have.
% Why our work matters.
Our work enables privacy engineers---in particular Tor developers---to improve
their technology.
