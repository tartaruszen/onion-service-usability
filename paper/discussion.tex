\subsection{Take-aways for Tor developers}

Several of our interview participants pointed out Tor Browser's antiquated user
interface.  Past work has shown that users interpret unrelated aspects such as
voice quality as a proxy signal for security, which raises the question if the
same holds true for user interface design~\cite[\S~IV.A]{Abu-Salma2017a}.  If
so, it is important to equip Tor Browser with a modern user interface.

        working with one of the authors.}

\subsection{Take-aways for Tor users}

The strong security properties of onion services are futile if users cannot tell
apart a genuine domain from its impersonation.  Awareness of this issue is the
first step and several onion services have long begun to alert their users.



% could tor show you when an onion service descriptor was first published?


\subsection{Take-aways for Tor researchers}

We found it challenging, yet rewarding and illuminating to study the Tor
community.  Tor users obviously value their privacy which reduces their
willingness to participate in research projects.  Past academic research
projects that involved questionable methods turned this care into distrust for
many users.  Showing willingness to directly interact with the community and
taking seriously their concerns signals respect and transparent methods.  For
our online survey, we recommend to use software that works in Tor
Browser\footnote{Note that Tor Browser supports three security levels; the
default of ``low,'' ``medium,'' and ``high.''  Some users brought to our
attention that our survey did not work when the security level is set to
``high'' because it disables JavaScript, which our survey required---an
oversight on our end.} and does not fetch tracking scripts such as Google
Analytics.  For the survey design, one likely has to forego asking questions
that are best practice such as income level and country of residence.  We made
even the basic information we asked optional so our respondents had the chance
to answer the survey without providing any personal information at all.  In our
interviews we tried to accomodate the needs of our participants by using
software of their choice.
