\subsection{Take-aways for Tor users}
\subsection{Take-aways for Tor researchers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Think about how much demographic information you really need.
    \item Avoid JavaScript.
    \item No trackers etc., and try to avoid third parties such as Google.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tor is working on a new onion service design~\cite{Mathewson2013a}.
        Anything we can say about that?
    \item Modern UI matters.  We know that people think less of security if UI
        looks bad.  Tor perceived as ``90s browsing experience.''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our demographic may not be representative because we selected people
        who may care more about onion sites than the average Tor user.  Many
        Tor users may do nothing other than download Tor Browser.
    \item Our survey was only in English, so it may not generalize well to
        non-English speakers.  We know that there are cultural differences in
        security behavior~\cite{Sawaya2017a}.
    \item We are only talking to Tor users.  People who never used Tor may also
        have interesting and valuable opinions.  There may be survivor bias in
        Tor -- only the people willing to put up with usability issues stick
        around.
\end{itemize}
