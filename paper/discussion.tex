\subsection{Take-aways for Tor developers}
\subsection{Take-aways for Tor users}
\subsection{Take-aways for Tor researchers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Think about how much demographic information you really need.
    \item Avoid JavaScript.
    \item No trackers etc., and try to avoid third parties such as Google.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tor is working on a new onion service design~\cite{Mathewson2013a}.
        Anything we can say about that?
    \item Modern UI matters.  We know that people think less of security if UI
        looks bad.  Tor perceived as ``90s browsing experience.''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Selection bias: Our demographic may not be representative because we
        selected people who may care more about onion sites than the average Tor
        user.  Many Tor users may do nothing other than download Tor Browser.
        Also, our demographic is self-selected.
    \item Cultural bias: Our survey was only in English, so it may not
        generalize well to non-English speakers.  We know that there are
        cultural differences in security behavior~\cite{Sawaya2017a}.
    \item Survivor bias: We may not have reached people who used to use Tor and
        stopped using it because of usability issues.  The people who remain can
        tolerate the usability issues.
    \item We are only talking to Tor users.  People who never used Tor may also
        have interesting and valuable opinions.  There may be survivor bias in
        Tor -- only the people willing to put up with usability issues stick
        around.
\end{itemize}
