\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We organize the presentation of our findings by topic, starting with Tor
Browser, and then onion service-specific topics such as service discovery and
the operation of onion services.  We interweave the results from our online
survey and from our interviews, focusing primarily on our survey data but
bringing up anecdotes and findings from our interviews as appropriate.

\subsection{The Tor Project}

While we focused on the usability of onion services and Tor Browser, our
interviews and some of our survey data provided insight into how users perceive
The Tor Project and the work it does.

\subsubsection{Education and documentation}

The Tor Project's documentation covers a wide array of issues, including
installation, use on Android, operation of relays, several FAQs, and a wiki.
Having worked with this documentation, some of our participants lamented its
scope:

\begin{displayquote}[P14]
Tor does a good job on their web site of telling you to modify your
[configuration] file, and then getting the onion set up.  But it's just very
basic.  I have to go [to] other people's blog post to find out.
\end{displayquote}

Comprehensive documentation is only useful if it is understood, \ie, available
in an array of different languages.  Another participant struggled with the lack
of localization.  While Tor Browser's user interface is available in Spanish,
the documentation is not:

\begin{displayquote}[P11]
Think more [about] the Spanish community\dots because in my case I'm trying to
train people to use Tor but I work in the indigenous communities and there are
some things that [are] hard for me to explain in terms of how you use Tor\dots
\end{displayquote}

\subsubsection{Public perception}

The Tor Project goes to great lengths to minimize the trust its users have to
place in it by publishing design documents, source code, and coordinating
development in public.  However, laypeople lack the skill while experts
typically lack the time to audit source code which is why trust and reputation
still matter.  Among our interview participants, The Tor Project enjoyed a lot
of trust:

\begin{displayquote}[P08]
Because, you guys\dots have the sort of\dots not a monopoly on trust, but you
have like a really great brand name when it comes to this stuff\dots
\end{displayquote}

While the work of Tor developers is held in high esteem, the content that is
hosted on onion services is perceived very differently.  Upon being told what an
onion service is, one participant sought clarification:

\begin{displayquote}[P03]
So it's like the Hidden Wiki and stuff like that, where you can buy drugs
and\dots or supposedly.
\end{displayquote}

Several interviewees voiced concern that their mere use of Tor may draw unwanted
attention.  Tor Browser comes with modules that disguise the fact that one is
using Tor but a standard Tor connection does not use these modules, making it
easy to identify for Internet service providers~\cite{pluggable}.  One
participant worried:

\begin{displayquote}[P03]
I guess you could put yourself on some kind of watch lists, that you are a
person of interest, just because you're using [Tor].
\end{displayquote}

\subsection{Tor Browser usage}

Our survey started with two general questions about the use of Tor Browser.
Figure~\ref{fig:tor-usage} illustrates how often our respondents use Tor
Browser.  Almost half of our participants use Tor Browser either daily or even
as their main browser.

Figure~\ref{fig:tor-threats} illustrates what entities our respondents seek to
protect themselves from when using Tor Browser.  The majority considers ad
companies, governments, and---most prominently---their ISP.  More relatable
entities such as family, employer, and school are less prevalent.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/tor-usage.tex}
    \caption{The usage frequency of Tor Browser among our respondents.  Almost
    half of our respondents use Tor Browser either daily or as their main
    browser.}
    \label{fig:tor-usage}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/tor-threats.tex}
    \caption{The threat actors that our respondents seek to protect themselves
        from by using Tor Browser.}
    \label{fig:tor-threats}
\end{figure}

People who selected ``Other'' gave a variety of responses.  A number of
respondents specifically pointed out Google and Facebook.  ISPs, backbone ISPs,
and web sites were another common theme.  A number of respondents are struggling
with personal threats that include identity theft, targeted harassment, and
stalking.  Research is another common theme: Several respondents want to learn
about a topic without revealing their interest in it.  Some respondents use Tor
for search engine optimization, computer security research, and to research
medical conditions.  Finally, Tor provides technical advantages that don't
involve a threat actor.  Some respondents want IPv6 connectivity, evasion of
geographical content restrictions, and access to onion services.  A small number
of respondents are only interested in technical aspects other than privacy.  One
respondent stated that they don't need anonymity themselves but instead use Tor
to provide cover traffic for ``people who need protection.''

\subsubsection{Quantifying anonymity is hard}

The degree of anonymity that protects a Tor user in a given situation depends on
a number of variables including her guard relay, intermediate autonomous systems
between the user and her destination, and other people that are using Tor at the
same time, just to name a few.  Unlike other anonymity tools such as
JAP~\cite{jap}, Tor Browser makes no attempt to display the degree of anonymity
it believes it can provide.  Asked about how well Tor works for them, one
of our participants explained:

\begin{displayquote}[P12]
In terms of the anonymity, you can't really tell\dots That's fairly opaque, so I
can't even tell how effective that's working, or whether it is\dots
\end{displayquote}

Quantifying anonymity in a real-world setting is complex, error-prone, and often
misleading.  What's more, Tor Browser does not have available all the data it
needs to quantify its user's anonymity---an ``anonymity meter'' may therefore
create more problems than it solves.

\subsubsection{Users like a view under the hood}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/tor-button-screenshot.jpg}
    \caption{A click on the onion icon reveals the Tor relays that constitute
    the circuit that was used to fetch the current page.}
    \label{fig:tor-button}
\end{figure}

Several of our participants enjoyed Tor Browser's visual feedback, illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:tor-button}, that shows the circuit that is used for a given
site.  One interviewee expressed delight about the interface:

\begin{displayquote}[P08]
I love how I can monitor the network through this little kind of bar that comes
up.
\end{displayquote}

Not satisfied with seeing only the current circuit, some participants wished it
were easier to learn what else is happening behind the scenes:

\begin{displayquote}[P02]
{[It]} would be nice to have some kind of application, something on that browser,
that gives you an impression of\dots what the Tor Browser's actually doing.
\end{displayquote}

Finding the right balance between what information to show and what to hide is
challenging in itself, and only exacerbated by Tor's heterogeneous user base:
While technical users may appreciate a look ``under the hood,'' non-technical
users, who often use Tor as a tool to get a specific job
done~\cite[\S~4.3.2]{Gallagher2017a}, can easily feel bewildered and
overwhelmed.  One aspect in which more transparency could indeed benefit Tor's
entire user base is when websites don't load, as suggested by one participant:

\begin{displayquote}[P05]
\dots maybe some sort of graphical representation of is the circuit still
being built, or is the circuit built, and the site isn't responding at all to
the third relay?
\end{displayquote}

\subsubsection{Users lament speed, user interface, and CAPTCHAs}

Perhaps the most prevalent issue is, still, browsing speed:

\begin{displayquote}[P01]
The speed of it is problematic; sometimes I have a path that allows me to watch
streaming full HD YouTube videos, and the next time, five minutes later, I'm
barely getting kilobytes through.
\end{displayquote}

Occasionally Tor is preceded by its reputation, preparing users for what to
expect:

\begin{displayquote}[P03]
I didn't think it was as slow as people say it was. People said it would be much
slower experience but\ldots a little bit slower, but it didn't matter for the
things that I was doing.
\end{displayquote}

In addition to the perceived slowness, several participants lamented the
old-fashioned user interface.  Tor Browser's looks were described as ``it felt
like it was about five years outdated,'' ``it looked like I was in 1982,'' and
``I think the colors look a bit old fashioned and in the former Soviet Union.''
Interestingly, one participant drew the opposite conclusion, expressing that the
antiquated user interface evoked trust:

\begin{displayquote}[P02]
At the same time I thought\ldots it gave them a certain amount of credibility,
like they weren't building this for the looks, but they were building it for
functionality\ldots  At the same time, as I thought it was outdated in terms of
how it looked, I also thought it was sort of genuine in a way.
\end{displayquote}

Orthogonal Tor's speed and user interface, the browsing experience occasionally
suffers.  Relying on naive, IP address-based metrics of ``maliciousness,'' some
content delivery networks such as Cloudflare label Tor exit relays as malicious
which results in Tor users having to solve (sometimes multiple) CAPTCHAs before
being granted access to a website.  In 2016, Khattak \ea documented the issue
for a number of content providers~\cite{Khattak2016a}.  One interviewee summed
up the situation as follows:

\begin{displayquote}[P06]
It is still sometimes challenging using some everyday services, because of
CAPTCHAs and those things, but I also understand that's not so much to do with
Tor, but to do with the creators of those web sites.
\end{displayquote}

\subsubsection{Tor Browser provides security, privacy, and control}

Let's turn to the advantages that our interviewees see in Tor Browser.  It comes
as no surprise that the main benefit of Tor Browser is the increase in privacy
and security, brought up by practically all of our participants.  One of our
more technical interviewees further distinguished between security and privacy.
Asked about if they feel safer when using Tor, they responded:

\begin{displayquote}[P06]
In a privacy sense, I do. In a security sense\ldots I don't assume that Tor is
protecting me from all of the vulnerabilities or exploits that I might
encounter\ldots
\end{displayquote}

Besides the obvious improvement in security and privacy, a defining aspect of
Tor is that it puts its users back in control, or, as one of our participants
eloquently put it:

\begin{displayquote}[P02]
I feel like I'm more in control of my internet experience that way, I'm not sort
of like a will-less victim of what other people want to do with me, so I feel
I'm more empowered and have more agency when I use the Tor Browser.
\end{displayquote}

\subsection{Onion service usage}

We now move on to results specific to onion services.

\subsubsection{Usage frequency}

The usage frequency of onion services is almost uniformly distributed among our
respondents; 24\% use onion sites less than once a month, 22\% use them about
monthly, 25\% weekly, and 23\% daily.  The remaining 6\% has never used an onion
service before.

The majority of our respondents (61.8\%) has used onion services for purposes
other than web browsing before.  Several protocols such as the chat application
Ricochet~\cite{ricochet} and the file sharing application
OnionShare~\cite{onionshare} were purpose-built on top of onion services while
existing TCP-based tools such as SSH can also be used with onion addresses
instead of traditional IP addresses.  Almost one third (29.7\%) of our
participants use onion service for non-browsing activities at least once a week.

But why do Tor users browse onion services in the first place?
Figure~\ref{fig:onion-usage} provides an answer.  The majority uses onion
services because of the additional anonymity (70\%) and the additional security
(61\%).  For 46\% it is the only way to access some content they enjoy, so using
onion services is a necessity.  27\% of our respondents found themselves curious
about the ``Dark Web'' and set out to find their own answer and 19\%
occasionally stumble upon links to onion services in their day-to-day browsing
activity.  Respondents who selected ``Other'' gave a variety of reasons, the
most predominant of which was the ability to set up a TCP service behind a NAT
device.  That way, it is possible to run an SSH server in a home network that
has neither a permanent IP address, nor port forwarding.  Other noteworthy
respondents use onion services to reduce the load on exit relays, to do
technical research, and to access sites that are otherwise unavailable.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/onion-usage.tex}
    \caption{Our respondents' (multiple choice) reasons for using onion
    services.}
    \label{fig:onion-usage}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mental models}

We asked our participants to draw sketches of how they believe Tor and onion
services work.\footnote{All sketches are available online at
\url{https://nymity.ch/onion-services/mental-models/}.}   Everybody drew a
sketch of Tor but some didn't draw onion services because they had no mental
model of it.  Interestingly, all participants understood that bouncing network
traffic across several relays is key to Tor's anonymity, as evidenced by
Figure~\ref{fig:tor-sketch} that stems from a participant with no technical
background.\footnote{Nevertheless the sketch got two details wrong: the number
of hops in a Tor circuit is three and the circuit's forward and reverse path are
identical.}  Analogously, most of our participants understood that network
traffic does not leave the Tor network when connecting to onion services.
Figure~\ref{fig:os-sketch} illustrates an example, again drawn by a
non-technical participant.  The last hop in the circuit is an onion, correctly
suggesting that network traffic does not leave the Tor network.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering

    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/tor-sketch.jpg}
        \subcaption{A non-technical interview subject's sketch of how they
        believe Tor works.  The participant correctly understands the concept of
        bouncing network traffic over several hops.}
        \label{fig:tor-sketch}
    \end{subfigure}

    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/os-sketch.jpg}
        \subcaption{A non-technical interview subject's sketch of their mental
        model of an onion service.  Instead of a web site, the final hop is
        another Tor hop.}
        \label{fig:os-sketch}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Sketches of two different, non-technical interview participants of
    how Tor works (top) and how onion services work (bottom).}
\end{figure}

Some of our interviewees did not distinguish disguising their IP address from
disguising their real-world identity, and instead used the umbrella term of
``anonymity'' to refer to both concepts.  This conflation of concepts paints an
incomplete picture of the security and privacy guarantees that Tor provides,
as evidenced by one participant's question:

\begin{displayquote}[P07]
What's the point of going to Facebook using onion services when their business
model is still about collecting your data?
\end{displayquote}

There is merit in using Facebook's onion service.  While the company obviously
knows who is logging in, they do not know Tor users' location, operating system,
or browser details.  On top of that, users get end-to-end security as well as
self-authenticating names.  These benefits are difficult to convey to
non-technical users and even experts sometimes advocate an ``all or nothing''
approach to online anonymity.

\subsubsection{Onion service discovery is a mess}

Recall that onion services are private by default, leaving it up to their
operator to disseminate the domain.  Established search engines such as Google
are therefore inadequate to find content on onion services.  We wanted to find
out how our respondents discover onion services.
Figure~\ref{fig:onion-discovery} illustrates the results.  The three most
popular ways of discovering new onion sites, all approximating 50\%, are social
networking sites such as Twitter and Reddit, the list of search engines such as
Ahmia\footnote{Ahmia.fi is an onion site search engine that crawls
user-submitted onion domains.  It publishes the list of all indexed onion
services at \url{https://ahmia.fi/onions/}.}, and randomly encountering links
when browsing the web.

While significantly less popular, discovering onion domains through friends and
family has the advantage of trust.  Some of our interview participant indicated
that they heavily rely on this distribution method simply because they can trust
the origin.  Finally, a mere 4\% indicated that they are not interested in
learning about new onion services.

Respondents who selected ``Other'' predominantly brought up
independently-maintained lists of onion services and aggregators.  A noteworthy
example is the Hidden Wiki.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/onion-discovery.tex}
    \caption{Our respondents' (multiple choice) methods of discovering onion
    services.}
    \label{fig:onion-discovery}
\end{figure}

The next question in our survey then asked if our respondents are satisfied with
the way they discover onion services.  60\% selected ``Yes'' while 40\% selected
``No.'' Some respondents who selected ``Yes'' brought up that they have no
interest in learning about new onion services, in part because they only use a
small set of onion services.  Among the people who are not satisfied, the most
prominent complaint was about broken links on onion site lists.  There is
non-trivial churn among onion sites and our respondents were frustrated that
existing lists are typically not curated and contain many dead links.

Many respondents were not aware of search engines such as ahmia.fi.  Among those
that were, many were not satisfied with both the search results and the number
of indexed onion sites.  Unsurprisingly, a ``Google for onion sites'' was a
frequent wish.

Several respondents were unhappy with existing aggregators.  In addition to
broken links, some distrust lists because they occasionally contain scam and
phishing sites.  The difficulty of telling apart two given onion domain names
exacerbates this issue.  Another common wish for aggregators was for them to be
more verbose in their description of onion sites.  In particular, some
respondents want to avoid illegal and pornographic content, which is often
difficult if the description is vague and the onion domain reveals nothing about
its content.

Many respondents expressed frustration about the difficulty of finding out if
site X also provides a corresponding onion service.  A common wish was to have
site X list its onion service prominently in a footer.  Ironically, some
respondents were surprised that torproject.org has a corresponding onion site --
they couldn't find it on the web site.

Interestingly, some respondents voiced frustration about various usability
issues, but mentioned in the same sentence that this is an inherent trade-off of
privacy technology, suggesting that there is nothing that can be done about it.

\subsubsection{Tools help managing the onion service domain format}

% An unrelated yet hardly unexpected source of confusion is the domain format of
% onion services.  Some users have come to believe that the seemingly-random
% characters in onion domains is the reason why onion services are anonymous.
% Accordingly, these users also believe that vanity domains are ``less anonymous''
% because part of their domains is clearly not random.

Conventional domains are designed to be easy to remember and recognize.  But how
do users handle the randomly-generated onion domains?  Question 3.8 in our
survey asked exactly that, with the responses being illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:onion-domain-mgmt}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/onion-domain-mgmt.tex}
    \caption{The strategies that our respondents use to handle onion domains.
    More than half use bookmarks inside of Tor Browser and a quarter thinks that
    there's no good solution.}
    \label{fig:onion-domain-mgmt}
\end{figure}

Most respondents use bookmarks inside Tor Browser for onion domains.  While
convenient, it leaves a trace of (presumably) visited sites on one's computer.
One of Tor Browser's security requirements is ``disk avoidance,'' \ie, the
browser must not write anything to disk that would reveal the user's browsing
history~\cite[\S~2.1]{Perry2017a}.  Bookmarking links is a violation of this
security requirement.  Many of our respondents were aware of this issue.  About
a dozen respondents who selected ``Other'' stated that they store onion domains
encryptedly---either in a text file or in their password manager.

Somewhat less popular is saving onion domains in local text files (36\%),
getting them from trusted web sites (34\%), use search engines (18\%), memorize
domains (16\%), use some other techniques (9\%) or employ pen and paper (8\%).
Notably, one quarter of our respondents does not have a good solution to the
problem.  Given the alarming number of (possibly insecure) home-baked solutions,
a Tor Browser extension may be warranted to approach the problem.

The next question in our survey asked if our respondents expect the
next-generation domain format to change their browsing habits.  Interestingly,
only 17\% expect to have their browsing habits changed while 83\% don't.  Among
the respondents who selected ``Yes,'' many expressed that they memorize a small
number of onion domains (such as Facebook's), which will no longer be possible.
People who selected ``No'' mostly bring up that they treat onion domains as
opaque identifiers that they handle via tools such as bookmarks.  These results
suggest that the current state is dire, yet not expected to get much worse with
the new domain format.

Problematic:
``I only memorize the first part of the domain''

``If there isn't some cognizable word at the start, it'll be more difficult for
me to determine if I'm going to the correct domain or a scam. I may end up going
to less .onion sites as a result.''

\subsubsection{Onion service operation}

A survey question block on onion service operation shed light on the reasons for
running onion services and what sort of issues users face when doing so.  40\%
of our respondents once set up an onion service.  Among the respondents who
never have, 31\% have considered doing so while 30\% have never even considered
it.  Interestingly, 79\% of operators have run an onion service for private use
while 53\% have run them for the public.

Figure~\ref{fig:onion-operation-reasons} gives an overview of the reasons for
running onion services.  Interestingly, the extra security properties overshadow
the anonymity properties of onion services.  Another particularly popular reason
is NAT traversal---many respondents noted that onion services allow them to
expose a TCP service in their home network despite being behind a NAT device.
Finally, some people run onion service indirectly because third-party tools such
as OnionShare~\cite{onionshare} or Ricochet~\cite{ricochet} are built on top of
them.  Onion services can have clear benefits for businesses as well as
evidenced by one respondent who wrote on onion services: ``We use it for
delivering updates to our router to customers securely and without leaking
metadata.''

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/onion-operation-reasons.tex}
    \caption{The reasons people have for running onion services.}
    \label{fig:onion-operation-reasons}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:onion-operation-concerns} illustrates the concerns that onion
service operators face.  We consider three attacks; \first somebody setting up a
phishing site for the operator's site, \second a denial-of-service attack, and
\third a deanonymization attack.  More than half of our respondents are at least
somewhat concerned about all of these attacks.  Almost 40\% claim to be
extremely concerned about somebody deanonymizing their onion service.  Indeed,
many respondents lamented the difficulty of knowing that an onion service setup
is robust against application-layer deanonymization attacks.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/onion-operation-concerns.tex}
    \caption{The level of concern onion service operators have with respect to a
    phishing clone of their service, denial-of-service attacks, and
    deanonymization.}
    \label{fig:onion-operation-concerns}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Susceptibility to phishing attacks}

Phishing remains an issue despite onion services' extra anonymity and security
properties.  Past work has uncovered an attack that transparently rewrote
Bitcoin addresses to hijack Bitcoin
transactions~\cite{Winter2016a,Nurmi2015a,Monteiro2016a}.  Key to this attack is
the difficulty of telling apart an authentic from an impersonation domain.  For
conventional domains we rely on (EV) certificates, browser protections, search
results, and long-lived reputation, but none of these methods work well for
onion services.  Does the nature of onion services facilitate phishing attacks?
If so, what can we do to mitigate the issue?

We asked our respondents if they ever thought about the authenticity of an onion
site.  With 80\%, the majority of our respondents did while 20\% didn't.
Clearly, there is a need for verification but how does one verify that an onion
service is authentic?  Figure~\ref{fig:determining-legitimacy} gives an overview
of the strategies that our respondents employ.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/determining-legitimacy.tex}
    \caption{How our respondents determine an onion service's legitimacy.}
    \label{fig:determining-legitimacy}
\end{figure}

More than half either consult trusted sources (\eg friends or another web site)
or use bookmarks when revisiting onion services.  Many respondents also verify
the domain in the browser's address bar (46\%), check if the corresponding web
site has a link to its onion site (41\%), or hope that the onion service has an
HTTPS certificate (36\%).\footnote{DigiCert is issuing EV-certificates for onion
sites~\cite{DigiCert2015a} but adoption has been slow---presumably in part
because EV certificates require the CA to verify the applicant's identity
and they are not for free.}  Alarmingly, almost 30\% of respondents stated that
they sometimes cannot tell the difference between an authentic service and an
impersonation, and 11\% never check a service's legitimacy in the first place.
People who selected ``Other'' provided a wide variety of ad-hoc phishing
protections---some clearly misguided, which reinforces the scope of the problem.

Originally meant to improve usability, vanity onion domains also play a role in
the context of phishing.  There is concern that the short and recognizable
prefixes tempt users to only verify the prefix and ignore subsequent
characters~\cite{Winter2015a}.  This oversight may allow attackers to create
impersonation domains that feature the prefix but differ in subsequent
characters.  Nurmi~\cite{Nurmi2015a} and Monteiro~\cite{Monteiro2016a} have both
documented such an attack but its effectiveness is not known.

The majority of our respondents appreciates vanity domains because they are easy
to remember (64\%), easy to recognize (64\%), and they provide a unique
``branding'' (34\%).  Some responses indicate that a vanity prefix conveniently
informs about an onion service's topic, letting visitors know what to expect.
Only 8\% dislike vanity onion domains and 15\% don't have an opinion.
Interestingly, some respondents consider vanity domains unfair because wealthy
entities can afford to generate longer prefixes.  Several respondents voiced
their concern that vanity domains create a false sense of security and
facilitate phishing attacks.  In a separate question we inquired how many
characters our respondents verify in onion domains.  43\% verify 13--16 digits,
\ie (almost) the full domain, while 46\% verify up to nine digits, which is
within the realm of brute force attacks.  Finally, a handful number of
respondents cited misguided reasons why they dislike vanity domains, \eg some
believe that vanity domains are a sign of weak hash functions while others
believe that vanity domains make the onion service ``less hidden'' or allow
somebody to create ``the same private key.''

\subsubsection{Perceived security}

Questions 6.4 and 6.6 asked how safe our respondents feel when using Tor Browser
and onion services, respectively.  Figure~\ref{fig:perceived-security} shows the
results.  Using Tor Browser makes 86\% of our respondents feel at least somewhat
safe.  The same is true for 67\% when using onion services---clearly not as many
as for Tor Browser.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \input{figures/perceived-security.tex}
    \caption{The level of security our respondents perceive when using Tor
    Browser (TB) and onion services (OSs).}
    \label{fig:perceived-security}
\end{figure}

Asked about why our respondents feel that way about Tor Browser, our results
reveal that non-experts lack the ability to evaluate (or even understand) Tor's
design which is why they defer to expert opinion, their gut feeling, or the
trust they have in Tor developers.  The Tor Project is perceived to take
security and privacy more seriously than any other browser vendor, which is
appreciated among our respondents.  Most of our respondents' criticism focused
not on Tor Browser but on the underlying Firefox code base.  Many participants
were unhappy with the exploit mitigation techniques, the lack of sandboxing, and
the complex code base.  Chrome was sometimes brought up as the golden standard
for browser security.\footnote{Note that our survey was run before Mozilla
released Firefox Quantum on Nov 14, 2017, which brought substantial improvements
in both security and usability.}  Malicious exit relays were a concern for a
handful of participants while another couple of participants are concerned that
their use of Tor makes them stick out and turn into a target for government
agencies.  Some participants weren't sure if their Tor setup works properly---a
common theme that we also noticed in our interviews: Non-technical users desire
visual feedback confirming that their network traffic comes out ``somewhere
else.''

With respect to onion services, the majority expressed that the added security
and anonymity makes them feel safe.  Another factor contributing to the
perceived security is that onion services make use of far fewer advertising
companies.  Orthogonal to the technology, many participants voiced concern about
illegal and questionable content on onion services, described by some as a
``Wild West.''  Phishing sites, honeypots, and compromised onion sites further
contribute to this perception.
